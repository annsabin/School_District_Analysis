## Summary of observations and conclusions


## About the Data

We are missing 10% of reading scores and 5% of math scores in this dataset. However, the remaining data is sufficient to get an overall sense of math and reading performance of public and charter high school students in this list.

Of note, Montgomery, Green, Dixon and Wagner high schools have the largest student counts. As such, the overall analysis results may be more representative of students in these schools.

## Overall Conclusions

Math scores are generally lower than reading scores. On average, both scores fall below 75. Efforts could be made to improve reading and math skills especially for students intending to enroll in college.

The data produces a paradox in the correlation between school budgets and higher performance.

Judging from performance-based percentiles, schools with higher budgets show better performance. Students in the 75th percentile for math and reading scores were enrolled in schools with budgets above 955k. By contrast, the budget of schools with students in the 25th percentile was ~100k less than the schools that produced highest performance.

However, public schools have slightly larger budgets than charter schools, yet overall math scores in public schools are lower that math scores in charter schools.

Lastly, Matthew Thomas, a 10th grader in Dixon High School, needs special attention. At 10.5, this student had the lowest reading score of all. His math score is slightly higher (58.4). However, both scores are well below standards and it would be worth exploring how to help him.
